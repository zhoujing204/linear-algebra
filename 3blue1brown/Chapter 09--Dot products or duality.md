# Chapter 9: Dot products or duality

Duality shows up in many different ways and forms throughout math and it's super tricky to actually define.

Loosely speaking, it refers to situations where you have a natural but surprising correspondence between two types of mathematical thing.

For the linear algebra case that you just learned about, you'd way that the "dual" of a vector is the linear transformation that it encodes. And the dual of a linear transformation from space to one dimension is a certain vector in that space.
